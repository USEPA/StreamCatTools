## StreamCatTools: Tools to work with the [StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset) API within R and access the full suite of StreamCat and [LakeCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat-dataset) metrics.


`StreamCatTools` is an R package for accessing [StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset) and [LakeCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat-dataset) data via the [StreamCat API](https://usepa.github.io/StreamCatWebServices_Public/#/) and for working with site data in conjunction with StreamCat and NHDPlus.
